Go (a.k.a., Golang) is a programming language first developed at Google. It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from C, but with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types (e.g., variable-length arrays and key-value maps), and a large standard library.> [wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29)
